# CameraPlus
CameraPlus is a Beat Saber mod that allows for multiple wide FOV cameras with smoothed movement, which makes for a much more pleasant overall spectator experience.

## ARCHIVED

I forked CameraPlus in order to implement transparent backgrounds for displaying avatars via a selfie/front-facing camera. However since then, the Beat Saber community has mostly moved on to Camera2. Also, I am no longer experimenting with avatars that much. As such, I will not be maintaining this. In the future, I might attempt to implement said feature in Camera2 however.

# Installing
1. Use the Mod Assistant : https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant/releases
		It is the easiest method, it will do all these steps below in 1 click.
	
### To install manually:
	1b. Make sure that Beat Saber is not running.
	2b. Extract the contents of the zip into Beat Saber's installation folder.
		For Oculus Home: \Oculus Apps\Software\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\
		For Steam: \steamapps\common\Beat Saber\
		(The folder that contains Beat Saber.exe)
	3b. Done! You've installed the CameraPlus Plugin.
# Usage
To edit the settings of any camera in real time, right click on the Beat Saber game window! A context menu will appear with options specific to the camera that you right clicked on!

Press <kbd>F1</kbd> to toggle the main camera between first and third person.

After you run the game once, a `cameraplus.cfg` file is created within the folder Beat Saber\UserData\CameraPlus. Any cfg files located in this folder will be used to render additional cameras.
Edit that file to configure CameraPlus:

## Movement Script
The sample script described in MovementScriptPath is located in the Beat Saber \ UserData \ CameraPlus \ Scripts folder.

### If ActiveInPauseMenu is set to false, there is a bug that the script doesn't return to its original state when SteamVR screen is displayed. 
```xml
{
    "ActiveInPauseMenu": true,     "ActiveInPauseMenu": Determines whether the camera pauses when pausing the game.
    "Movements": [                 "Movements"        : Position description section of the moving camera.
    {

## For developers

### Contributing to CameraPlus
In order to build this project, please create the file `CameraPlus.csproj.user` and add your Beat Saber directory path to it in the project directory.
This file should not be uploaded to GitHub and is in the .gitignore.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <!-- Set "YOUR OWN" Beat Saber folder here to resolve most of the dependency paths! -->
    <BeatSaberDir>E:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber</BeatSaberDir>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

If you plan on adding any new dependencies which are located in the Beat Saber directory, it would be nice if you edited the paths to use `$(BeatSaberDir)` in `CameraPlus.csproj`

```xml
...
<Reference Include="BS_Utils">
  <HintPath>$(BeatSaberDir)\Plugins\BS_Utils.dll</HintPath>
</Reference>
<Reference Include="IPA.Loader">
  <HintPath>$(BeatSaberDir)\Beat Saber_Data\Managed\IPA.Loader.dll</HintPath>
</Reference>
...
```

Currently, due to limitations with Unity's Graphics library, a shader is applied in the form of a `Material` using green as the Chroma Key to achieve the effect for `AvatarOnly`. It may therefore be necessary to rebundle the shader using the contents [here](CameraPlus/Unity).
